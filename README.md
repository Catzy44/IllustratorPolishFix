# IllustratorPolishFix
This script fixes issue with writing Polish characters in Adobe Illustrator

You need to install AutoHotkey to use it.

Also, for the script to work you first need to go into Illustrator key mappings and disable key mappings for your special characters.

For example im Polish these are 
CTRL+ALT+A
CTRL+ALT+C
CTRL+ALT+O
CTRL+ALT+L
CTRL+ALT+S
CTRL+ALT+X
CTRL+ALT+Z
Go into Key Mappings and disable them all!

If your language uses any special characters other than these - you need to modify the script.
